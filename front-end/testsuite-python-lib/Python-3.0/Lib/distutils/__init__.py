# Distutils version
#
# Please coordinate with Marc-Andre Lemburg <mal@egenix.com> when adding
# new features to distutils that would warrant bumping the version number.
#
# In general, major and minor version should loosely follow the Python
# version number the distutils code was shipped with.

#--start constants--
__version__ = "3.0"
